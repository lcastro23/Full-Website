          <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
          <p>My name is Lauren Castro and I'm a passionate web developer! While rather new in the field, I strive to create the best web pages possible for individuals or companies that want them. I first found the passion for web design when I was helping my friend with an issue regarding promotion. They had a group hobby that they wanted to promote but they didn't know how. I began looking into ways to promote their hobby and came across web design. At first, I had no idea what any of it meant -- the code was confusing, Javascript was downright intimidating and I was at a loss for what to do. But I wanted to come through for my friend and give them a platform that they could use. And so I took a chance on web design and ended up creating a relatively simple yet effective website for them. It wasn't professional by any means, but it fit their criteria well enough. After that, I felt a strange sense of achievement and wondered if this was a career path. Sure enough, when I was signing up for classes at Valencia College, I saw that Web Development was in fact a career.</p>

          <p>I was obsessed with it at that point, and began to pursue a degree in web design. I came to appreciate how simple lines of code could promote peoples' ideas, hopes, dreams and thoughts on the internet. Without web pages, the internet would be entirely pointless. That, or incredibly hard to decipher. I'm almost finished with my time at Valencia, but already I've been working on the side making websites for friends and colleagues, and am considering going into the real world to make sites for businesses. </p>
