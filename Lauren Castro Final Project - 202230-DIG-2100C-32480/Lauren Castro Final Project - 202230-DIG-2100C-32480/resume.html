          <h1>Resume</h1>
<p>In regards to education, I'm a self-taught web developer who decided to go to college for internship purposes. I'm enrolled in a 2-year program at Valencia College in Orlando FL, and since starting my degree I've learned a lot. Javascript and intermediate HTML (as well as CSS) have been added to my toolbelt of coding languages and I've only just begun. Prior to coding, I also had a few jobs that have helped me in numerous ways. Even retail can benefit you in a coding career.</p>
        
<h2>What do other jobs have to do with coding?</h2>

<p>Lots of life lessons can be learned from what jobs you have. And, in some circumstances, those lessons or skills you learn can be applied to other career paths. A lot of jobs require universal skills that you can learn just about anywhere! For example, you need public speaking as a requirement if you want to be a politician. But technically you can learn that from anywhere.</p>



<h2>Target Cashier</h2>

<p>Requirements for a cashier include speaking to customers on their level, carrying out purchases, handling money, assisting with discounts and returns, and overall making sure customers are happy with their products. You are also representing the brand you work for, and therefore must adhere to the brand's regulations, code of conduct and other requirements.</p>

<p>While working as a cashier, I learned a lot about teamwork and organization as well as time management. Multiple things can happen within thirty minutes, and you always need to be on top of it.</p>

<h2>Farrier</h2>

<p>Requirements for a farrier include having knowledge of a horse's biology, understanding the behavior of horses, being capable of lifting heavy objects, and not minding working in extreme weather. </p>

<p>When I was a farrier, I was expected to treat all the horses I worked on with respect and care. Each one had their own personalities and their own problems that I was expected to figure out. Because of this, I learned how to be a problem solver, critically think about how to approach each situation, and overall keep the horses happy.</p>

<h2>Moderator</h2>

<p>The requirements for a moderator position, regardless of being a business setting or personal, involve having great communication skills and an understanding of morality, equality and ethics. Moderators are expected to keep conversations civil within the platform they are monitoring, to prevent unrest and arguments from breaking out. Typically these platforms are public, and moderators are a necessity in that regard.</p>

<p>I was invited to be a moderator for a game that was being rewritten from the ground up. The game itself was previously owned by Disney, who decided to retire the platform in 2014. Since then, volunteer programmers have been working on the game in order to bring it back to a functional state. In the meantime, they owned a Discord server that was used to promote the game itself -- but it was heavily understaffed and required moderator. I was quick to jump in and assist them, learning not only how to talk to people who are upset, but to have an understanding of all sorts of backgrounds. Despite being primarily about talking to people, I was also expected to manage spreadsheets and keep documentation of my interaction, which definitely helped me learn how to use software.</p>
