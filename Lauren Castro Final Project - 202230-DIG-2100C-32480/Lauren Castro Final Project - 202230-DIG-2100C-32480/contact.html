        <h1>Commissions</h1>

        <p>If you would like to commission a website with my current skillset, please feel free to reach out to me!</p>

        <p>Commissions are accepted on a first-come-first-serve basis and you may pay for them in a variety of ways.</p> 

        <p>The first method is the bundle method. There are three bundles: Standard, Special, and the Full bundle. These bundles are restrictive for the fact that they're simply default templates. The Standard bundle comes with four web pages, the Special bundle comes with six and the Full comes with at least 10 web pages. These pages can be whatever the customer specifies. Since there is little customization involved, these template bundles are priced as follows: $50 for the Standard bundle, $70 for the Special and $90 for the Full.</p> 

        <p>The second method is hourly payment. This method is more for customers who want a really specific website design and want to take their time on it. While it requires more communication between me and the customer, it's usually the most popular. The website can be as big as the customer desires, with any kind of features they request. But the longer it takes to finish, the higher the price. The hourly price starts at $15 and continues each time the customer adds more features. The more difficult the website, the longer it's going to take to finish. While I am still a novice, I cannot in my right mind charge people full price as I am not yet a professional. But my commissions are a good alternative for individuals who want something simple.</p>
