          <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
          <p>My name is Lauren Castro and I'll be taking you on a little trip. Through my lovely website, I hope to tell you a little bit about myself and my skillsets. As you can see, I am a web developer -- a novice at the very least. In regards to this site, I've made it resizable, meaning that if you minimize or resize the window, the text and containers will move to fit the adjustment. There is also a navbar just below the colorful flower header which you can use to travel across this site's various pages -- all links should be functional.
          </p>

          <p>The overall design of the website is aimed to be as relaxing as possible to look at while using my favorite color -- purple! I love lavenders and the color green goes great with them. And so you'll see the two colors frequently as you explore. Also, if you haven't noticed yet, the cursor is completely custom! Some bullet points and link hovers are also customized to fit with the overall theme of the site.
